# PARAMETER FILE for BAIT_validate
#
# Controls the appearance and navigation of spectrogram plots, and the appearance of marker boxes
# that denote detections or annotation. Also controls which channel to use for multi-channel
# reordings (this can be set here directly, or determined interactively).

# Compatible with BAIT release 2023-12-08

# AUDIO CHANNEL
#--------------
    ChannelNumber = prompt	# Channel number to use if recordings have multiple channels; specify 'prompt' (without quotes) to set the channel interactively


# SPECTROGRAM SETTINGS
#---------------------
    WinSize = 0.256	# Spectrogram window size, in seconds
    StepSize = 0.032	# Spectrogram time step size, in seconds
    NFFT_8kHz = 2048	# Number of points to use in FFT if recording were sampled at 8 kHz (the actual number will be adjusted for the correct sampling rate)


# PLOT PARAMETERS
#----------------
    TSpanDefault = 6 		# Time span of the viewing window at the base zoom level
    FMaxDefault = 500  		# Upper frequency limit at the base zoom level
    TPanFactor = 0.75  		# Factor by which to step forward or back in time when panning, relative to the time span of the current view
    TZoomFactor = 2  		# Factor by which to increase the time span of the viewing window when "zooming out" in time
    FZoomFactor = 2  		# Factor by which to increase upper frequency limit when "zooming out" in frequency
    DefaultColormap = bone	# Name of the colormap to use on startup (see user manual for a list)


# MARKER PARAMETERS
#------------------
    LineWidth = 2  			# Width of the marker edge lines
    FaceAlpha = 0.05  			# Transparency of the inside of the marker box. 0 is fully transparent (invisible), 1 is opaque.
    StandardFRange = [0, 500]  		# Frequency limits of call marker bounding boxes
    Color_DetectedFocal = [0.5, 0, 0]  	# Color of box around the detected call in focus, specified as an array of RGB values in the range 0-1
    Color_DetectedOther = [0, 0, 0]  	# Color of boxes around detected calls not in focus, specified as an array of RGB values in the range 0-1
    Color_MissedDefinite = auto  	# Color of boxes around definite missed calls, specified as an array of RGB values in the range 0-1 OR the string 'auto'
    Color_MissedPotential =  auto 	# Color of boxes around potential missed calls, specified as an array of RGB values in the range 0-1 OR the string 'auto'
    Color_Annotations = auto  		# Color of general annotation boxes, specified as an array of RGB values in the range 0-1 OR the string 'auto'
